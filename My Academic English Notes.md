## Grammar

写在前面：很多表达方式都是grammatical，核心是想表达的内涵

### Article

1. Can I omit articles in a noun series?

* 总结：省略(体现/强调)整体的联系，不省略(体现/强调)分离的个体

* [ellipsis - Is it okay to omit an article after the word "or" because it is redundant? - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/270659/is-it-okay-to-omit-an-article-after-the-word-or-because-it-is-redundant)

  > It's not really a matter of omitting an article. Grammatically, when you have one article, it's because there is just one noun phrase and a single article which comes before a single noun. This is because of the way conjunction works in language. When you combine several words or phrases with "and" or "or", you wind up with a single phrase of the same category as each of the things which were combined.

* [grammar - Can articles be omitted in front of the second and third nouns? - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/270511/can-articles-be-omitted-in-front-of-the-second-and-third-nouns)

  > **Example 1**: I bought **a** lemon, melon, and pineapple.
  >
  > **Example 2**: I asked her to pass me **the** pen, eraser, and pencil sharpener
  >
  > Peter Shor: Leaving out the articles is grammatical. But we're more likely to leave out repeated definite articles than indefinite ones. 
  >
  > And we're much more likely to leave out the article when the items are connected. For example, Ngram shows "a car and trailer" is more common than "a car and a trailer"; but "a car and house" is less common than "a car and a house" (although both forms are used in both cases).
  >
  > And while "he gave me a box of chocolates and bouquet of roses" sounds fine to me, I think you really should put two articles in "he gave me an octopus and bouquet of roses".
  >
  > Brian Hitchcock: In the second, it might be that there was only one each of pen, eraser, and pencil sharpener (or only one that she had, or had access to.) In that case, "the" can distribute across all three items, exactly as you wrote the sentence.

* adj+n: [grammar - Omitting repeated definite article - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/225675/omitting-repeated-definite-article)

  > Repeating the article can avoid ambiguity when adjectives get involved.

  [articles - Is it necessary to use "the" multiple times? - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/9487/is-it-necessary-to-use-the-multiple-times)

  > the + adj1, adj2, and adj3 + n，共3个还是1个，与n的单复数形式有关，如果省略后”把3个变成不想表达的1个“/有歧义，则不省略

  > 举例: 歧义 the black dog and cat

  * [When to omit the article before a noun? - English Language Learners Stack Exchange](https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/281728/when-to-omit-the-article-before-a-noun)

    > 学术案例：If you do use the article "a" or "the", you can probably specify when and where that instance of analysis occurred.

  * [usage - Can I omit "the" in those sentences? - English Language Learners Stack Exchange](https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/228411/can-i-omit-the-in-those-sentences)

  * > In your first two examples, you refer to *specific* drawings by labelling them "Drawing A" and "Drawing B". As this naming convention already makes it clear which is which, there is *no need* for the definite article.
    >
    > Samtec Text Editor™ is faster than competing products.
    >
    > The Samtec text editor is faster than the other text editors.



2. Same, a same, the same?

>  GRAMMAR 
>  ►Same usually has the before it. same 前面一般都有 the: 
>  They both gave the same reasons for leaving.
>  他们俩给的离开的理由是一样的。
>  All the shirts looked the same.
>  所有这些衬衫看上去都一样。
>  ►You can also use this or that before same when it is used as an adjective, to emphasize it. same 用作形容词时，前面也可以使用 this 或 that 加以强调: 
>  At that same moment the telephone rang.
>  就在这同时，电话铃响了。
>  ► Same never has a before it. same 前面从不用 a: 
>  We went to the same school (NOT a same school).
>  我们上的是同一所学校。
>  ► You can say that one thing is the same as another. Do not use like or with . 表示一物与另一物相同，可以说 the same as，不可用 like 或 with 来替换 as: 
>  His answer was the same as mine (NOT the same like / with mine).
>  他的回答和我的一样。



3. most or most of?

   **We use most before a noun without a determiner.** **We use most of before a pronoun and a noun with a determiner** (e.g. articles, demonstratives and possessives). Most of is also used before personal or geographical names.

[Should I always use a comma after “e.g.” or “i.e.”?](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/16172/should-i-always-use-a-comma-after-e-g-or-i-e)

[Is it “vs”, “vs.” or “v.s.”? - Quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-vs-vs-or-v-s)

> As others have said, “v.s.” is wrong.
>
> [British usage](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=vs%2Cvs.&year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=18&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cvs%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cvs.%3B%2Cc0) is split between “vs” and “vs.”; [American usage](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=vs%2Cvs.&year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=17&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cvs%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cvs.%3B%2Cc0) overwhelmingly prefers “vs.” (as of 2008)… if you trust Google ngrams.
>
> If you want to approximate professional printing (which is easy with any word processor), you should italicize the various Latin abbreviations and words: *vs., etc., e.g., i.e., et al., cf., q.v., sic, loc.sit., s.v., passim, …* Some style guides now consider them completely assimilated, and so recommend not italicizing.
>
> Writing out *versus* or *et cetera* is heavy, pedantic, and unnecessary.
>
> Fun fact: many of these were traditionally *spoken* in English, not Latin (*etc.* = “and so on”, not etsetera; *i.e.* = “that is”, not eye-ee or idest; *cf.* = “compare”, not see-eff or confer; *viz.* = “that is” or “namely”, not viz or videlicet).
>
> In legal writing, they use “v.” rather than “vs.” in the names of cases (*e.g.* Smith v. Jones), and they pronounce it *vee* rather than *versus* or *against.* (see [Is it a faux pas in legal circles to say "v." … aloud as "versus" instead of "vee"?](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-a-faux-pas-in-legal-circles-to-say-v-as-in-Bush-v-Gore-aloud-as-versus-instead-of-vee?ch=10&share=4e5176e8&srid=tu0)). I don’t know if it’s not typically italicized because courts like their briefs to look like they came from typewriters (!) or because they actually prefer roman to italic as a matter of style.



### Singular/plural

1. and/or

[Singular or Plural with And, Or, Nor, As Well As? Verbs with Compound Subjects | Editor’s Manual (editorsmanual.com)](https://editorsmanual.com/articles/compound-subject-singular-or-plural/)

> Two or more nouns joined by and are usually plural.
>
> Two or more nouns joined by **or or nor** may take singular or plural verbs depending on the noun closest to the verb.
>
> With expressions like **as well as, together with, and including**, **the subject does not change in number**. If it is singular, it remains singular.
>
> EXAMPLES
>
> Lulu, Rita, and Nesbit  have  built a spaceship in their backyard.
> Either my mother or my sister  has  sent me these flowers.
> Neither Maya nor Sam works  full-time anymore.
> The new as well as the old version  is  now available.

2. kind/sort/type of

> Grammar Point
>
> - **Use the singular (kind/sort) or plural (kinds/sorts) depending on the word you use before them:**
>
>   **用单数（kind/sort）还是复数（kinds/sorts）取决于之前的用词：**
>
> o each/one/every kind of animal每一种／一种／每一种动物
>
> o all/many/other sorts of animals.所有／许多／其他种类的动物
>
> - **Kind/sort of** is     followed by a singular or uncountable noun: kind/sort of 后接单数名词或不可数名词：
>
> o This kind of question often appears in the exam.这类问题在考试中经常出现。
>
> o That sort of behaviour is not acceptable.那样的行为是不允许的。
>
> - **Kinds/sorts of** is     followed by a plural or uncountable noun: kinds/sorts of 后接复数名词或不可数名词：
>
> o These kinds of questions often appear in the exam.这几类问题在考试中经常出现。
>
> o These sorts of behaviour are not acceptable.这种行为是不允许的。
>
> - Other variations are possible     but less common:亦可能有其他结构，只是较少见：
>
> o These kinds of question often appear in the exam.此类问题在考试中经常出现。
>
> o These sort of things don’t happen in real life.这类事情在现实生活中不会发生。
>
> (This example is very informal and is considered incorrect by some people.)
>
> - Note also that these examples     are possible, especially in spoken English:另注意下列例句，尤其在口语中可能出现：
>
> o The shelf was full of the sort of books I like to read.书架上摆满了我喜欢读的那种书。
>

[word choice - When are "because", "since","for" and "as" interchangeable? - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/6993/when-are-because-since-for-and-as-interchangeable)

> 1. "because" is your best choice for clear, correct, unambiguous communication, especially if you want to be understood easily by other non-native speakers.
> 2. "since" is acceptable, although it makes your statement ambiguous; the second meaning would be that statement A became true at the time that statement B became true. Example: "I study more often since I enrolled in class" conveys that when you enrolled in class, then you began studying more often. Rule of thumb: prefer "since" when your intent is to convey "from the time that".
> 3. "as" is somewhat acceptable, but in your particular statement structure "as" has more useful meanings of "abstractly analogous" or "synchronously". Example: "I like apples as you like oranges" conveys that my liking is similar to your liking, i.e. equivalently strong/weak/notable/etc. Example: "I make dinner as you set the table" conveys that we do these tasks at the same time in the same place. Rule of thumb: prefer "as" when your intent is to convey "sameness".
> 4. "for" can be acceptable, although I would never expect to hear it in normal conversation. It would come across as overly-academic, or possibly epic or religious. Example: "We eat well tonight, for tomorrow we go to war." Rule of thumb: prefer "for" when you want to be poetic and inspirational.

[As, because or since ? - English Grammar Today - Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/as-because-or-since)

> ## *Because*
>
> *Because* is more common than *as* and *since*, both in writing and speaking. When we use *because*, we are focusing on the reason
>
> ## *As* and *since*
>
> We often use *as* and *since* when we want to focus more on the result than the reason. *As* and *since* are more formal than *because*. We usually put a comma before *since* after the main clause:

['Because,' 'Due To,' 'Since,' and 'As' | Grammar Girl (quickanddirtytips.com)](https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/because-due-to-since-and-as): So if you find yourself agreeing with traditionalists—or if your writing will be judged by one—use “due to” if you can substitute “attributable to,” “caused by,” or “resulting from.” And don’t use it at the beginning of a sentence.

### Addition

furthermore 强化信息；moreover 相关信息；besides 不相关信息

[Also, Furthermore, Moreover, Besides – Scientific Writing Program at NYU Abu Dhabi](https://wp.nyu.edu/sciwriabudhabi/2018/07/31/also-furthermore-moreover-besides/)

> **Furthermore** functions like **also** except that it is used when *advancing an argument*. If you are listing reasons for your argument, you list the first reason, and then when you introduce another reason, you can precede it with **furthermore**. It suggests that you have a line of reasoning, and you are furthering that same particular line with additional evidence. It conveys a sense of building.
>
> **Moreover** is the next level up from **furthermore**. **Also** is simple addition, **furthermore** is addition and advancing an argument, whereas **moreover** is addition, advancing an argument, and indicating that the added reason is of a ***different kind*** than previously furnished reasons. It suggests that that even if you weren’t convinced by this particular line of reasoning, there’s this other line of reasoning that is fundamentally different but still points to the same conclusion.
>
> **Besides** is the next level up from **moreover**. **Besides** signals that the game is over. It’s for when you have already listed satisfactory reasons to win your argument, and **(1) you are just adding a cherry on top, and/or (2) you are negating the importance of the entire argument.** It suggests that you are concluding one arena of argument and moving to a different ball park altogether. It can suggest that even if the entire previous argument were completely wrong, you should accept he conclusion for this other reason that might even render the previous discussion moot.

> You are a bad person. You cheat and you lie. **Furthermore**, you steal.
>
> I don’t like Rufus the dog. He’s disobedient and mean. **Moreover**, Julie doesn’t like Rufus the dog, either
>
> Person 1: Should we stop at Burger King?
>
> Person 2: No. Burger King is gross **and** disgusting. **Furthermore**, I get sick every time I eat there. **Moreover**, we’re in a hurry. **Besides**, I’m not even hungry.



### Others

impact一般指坏的影响, effect 和 influence则好坏都可以



which or that?

**In a defining clause, use that.** **In non-defining clauses, use which**. Remember, which is as disposable as a sandwich bag. If you can remove the clause without destroying the meaning of the sentence, the clause is nonessential and you can use which.

>
> Portion is interchangeable with slice/section/piece so fits your sentence.
>
> If you're asked what proportion you'd usually answer with a quantity, fraction or percentage. So it doesn't fit your sentence, it would be like repeating yourself.
>
> A ratio is made up of 2 or more parts e.g. 3:1



First or Firstly: First is better

[Firstly, Secondly, Thirdly—Using Ordinal Adverbs | Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/firstly/)

> Nevertheless, there are good reasons for choosing the “first” sequence over the “firstly” sequence.
>
> First, using *first* is a sure win. If your writing is being published or evaluated, or even if you would like to seem proficient to your coworkers, use the construction that is never criticized rather than the one that is frequently criticized.
>
> Second, the unnecessary *-ly* may not seem pretentious to you when applied to the lower numbers, but they will, once you follow them logically up the scale. Beyond fourthly and fifthly, they become quite ridiculous. (Seventhly? Eleventhly?)
>
> Third, have you ever noticed that *firstly* doesn’t have a cognate in the idioms we use every day? You would never say *firstly come, firstly served* or *at firstly glance*.
>
> Whichever system you choose, avoid mixing your methods. For example, using *firstly* then *second* and *third*, will simply open you up to more censure, even if there is no hard-and-fast rule to stop you.



Difference between imagery and image

* 泛指和特指？

* [Imagery Vs Images? (englishforums.com)](https://www.englishforums.com/English/ImageryVsImages/phnwr/post.htm)

  > I know I'm a little late to the game on this post, but the term "imagery" is often used in satellite and remote sensing organisations and in the military to refer to what is usually a collection of images of a certain geographic area, frequently taken in non-visible parts of the electro-magnetic spectrum. I think "imagery" is used instead of "images" to distinguish between a plain photo and the much greater amount of data that is contained within one single satellite image. It could also just be professional organisations wanting to use their own jargon, or simply a usage that fell into favour amongst those who deal with large collections of images used for the purpose of gathering data. In short, yes, that can be the correct use of the term "imagery", however I don't think using "images" in its place would ever be considered incorrect.
